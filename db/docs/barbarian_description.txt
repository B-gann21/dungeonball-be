Left and Right Guards have a specific duty on the offensive line, just like a Barbarian is a specific kind of Fighter. The task of the guards is to protect the Quarterback and running backs (Wizards and other Fighters, respectively) from the other team’s defenders. Although the Guards are technically an offensive position, they must think defensively in order to keep the other team’s defenders from interfering with the Quarterback so he can formulate and execute a plan.
