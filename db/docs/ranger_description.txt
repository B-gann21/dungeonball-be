Kickers, punters, kick returners, and long-snappers make up a “special team” within the team, and as such can be likened to Rangers. Special teams in Football are responsible for kicking the ball (if on the offense) or returning the other team’s kicks (if on the defense). Not all players are skilled enough to perform this role, but there is a trade-off in physicality that comes with this position.
