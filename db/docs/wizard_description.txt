Quarterbacks are like Wizards with a tactical acumen because they use their knowledge to read the field, predict likely avenues of attack, and “cast spells” (pass the football) in order to advance. The Quarterback is the only player allowed to pass the ball forward. Like Wizards, they rely on their burlier teammates to protect them, as they are somewhat squishier than classes more suited to melee.
