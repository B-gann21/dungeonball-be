Linebackers perform like Clerics in that their responsibilities are primarily defensive. They must be capable of stopping the other team’s running backs who make it across the defensive line and stopping or covering passes from the other team’s Quarterback that come across the middle. However, if the other team’s line leaves a gap where they are vulnerable, linebackers can rush the other team’s Quarterback in a “blitz” play.
