Halfbacks and Fullbacks are offensive positions, and they carry the ball on most rushing plays. Sorcerers, like Wizards, must read the field and attempt to advance the ball (cause damage) but they donâ€™t pass the ball forward like a Quarterback does. A Wizard (QB) may perform like a Sorcerer sometimes, if they are good at running as well as passing.
