Defensive backs are like Rogues, because they can be everywhere at once, and can not only defend against long passes by running after receivers, but also rush the other teamâ€™s Quarterback. They work alongside the Linebackers (Clerics) and like them are primarily defensive, although they can sometimes intercept a pass and use their speed to run it down the field to gain yards or score.
